# MyCF
A very initial stage of my crowd-Funding project, using Play Framework 2.6.x (JAVA) and Elasticsearch 6.0.0. Currently It has an elasticsearch query Utility file(check inside app/ESWrapper folder). Currently am working on building the elastisearch support for the required framework. After that , i'll begin the class design and develop the framework. Please feel free to suggest/correct any changes in it. You can reach out to me via mail( aniket9304@gmail.com) or linkedin( https://linkedin.com/in/aniketpandey15).
